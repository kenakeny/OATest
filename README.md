**NeetCode 150 â€“ Python Cold Start Project**

**Objective:**  
Accelerate Python mastery and DSA by learning & finishing the NeetCode 150 problem set using Python  
This project is a 3-day challenge set by myself to have fun and prepare for any coding assessment.

## ðŸ’» Environment

- Language: Python 3

Title 
Title: Two Sum (LeetCode #1)
Time: 13 minutes
Difficulty: Easy
Category: Arrays & Hashing
Approach:
- Use a hash map to store complement and index.
- If complement found, return indices.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)
